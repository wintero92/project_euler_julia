"""
    p_0004(digits::Integer = 3)::Integer

Calculates the largest palindrome that is a product of two numbers, each having a specified number of digits. This algorithm employs a strategic approach to enhance the efficiency of the palindrome search. Key to this approach is the insight that in any product resulting in an even-digit palindrome, at least one of the multipliers must be divisible by 11. This property stems from the characteristics of number theory relevant to the digits of products.

# Arguments
- `digits::Integer`: Specifies the number of digits in the numbers to be multiplied. The default is set to 3.

# Returns
- `Integer`: The largest palindrome which is a product of two numbers each having `digits` digits.

# Examples
```julia
julia> p_0004(2)
9009  # This result comes from 91 * 99 = 9009, the largest palindrome from the product of two 2-digit numbers.

julia> p_0004(3)
906609  # This result comes from 913 * 993 = 906609, the largest palindrome from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
