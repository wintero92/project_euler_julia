    collatz_length(n::Integer, cache::Dict{Int, Int}) -> Integer

Calculates the length of the Collatz sequence starting from `n`. Utilizes a cache to store and reuse previously
computed lengths of sequences for efficiency. The Collatz sequence is defined such that for a given number `n`:
- If `n` is even, the next number is `n / 2`.
- If `n` is odd, the next number is `3n + 1`.
- This process repeats until `n` becomes 1.

# Arguments
- `n::Integer`: The starting number of the Collatz sequence.
- `cache::Dict{Int, Int}`: A dictionary used to store lengths of Collatz sequences for previously computed numbers.

# Returns
- `Integer`: The length of the Collatz sequence starting from `n`.

# Examples
```julia
julia> collatz_length(13, Dict(1 => 1))
10  # Explanation: The sequence for 13 has 10 steps.

    p_0014(limit::Integer = 1_000_000) -> Integer

Finds the starting number under `limit` that produces the longest Collatz sequence. Uses a cache to optimize
the computation of sequence lengths.

# Arguments
- `limit::Integer`: The upper boundary (exclusive) for checking starting numbers. Default is 1,000,000.

# Returns
- `Integer`: The starting number under `limit` that produces the longest Collatz sequence.

# Examples
```julia
julia> p_0014(1_000_000)
837799  # This is the starting number under 1,000,000 that produces the longest Collatz sequence.
